# AnnulaLeaveProject
Spring boot application

You have to provide an Annual Leave Web Application which should do the following:

 

Ø  Provide a login page for the user (user, supervisor, finance, and admin role), and a log-out functionality as well.

Ø  All users can update and reset passwords.

Ø  On successful login, the user can apply for days off/vacations /compensation days.

Ø  The user will have the right to apply for days off can see how many days remaining and previous applications done.

        Users can use annual leave only after passing a probation period of 90 days.

Ø  The supervisor can approve or reject applications sent to him/her. The reason is needed in case the request is rejected.

Ø  Besides the web app, the user and supervisor will be notified via email for annual leave changes.

Ø  The user will get an email when the application is accepted/rejected, and Supervisor will get a New Leave Request on email as well ( optional).

Ø  The admin has the option to create, update or delete users.

Ø  User can create, update, or delete applications ( also can filter applications)

Ø  All CRUD APIs need to be developed as REST Web Services
